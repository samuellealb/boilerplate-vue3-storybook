### Testing

## Features and good practices
   
### Mocker Mode / Server Mode   
- All scripts run mocker server by default.   
- To consume server data, you have to define the server URL in the `VITE_API_URL` variable, at `.env` file, and add `:server` to script name. e.g. `yarn dev:server`.  
- All MSW config and data files must be placed inside `/src/mocks`   
- Data objects are exported from `/src/mocks/data.js`
- Request handlers are configured at `/src/mocks/handlers.js` and are used by Vue and Storybook from here.
   
### Component styling, testing and prototyping
- CSS files meant for general used must be placed under `/styles` directory.
- ***Component-specific style***, ***test cases*** and ***stories*** files must be placed under the ***component's root directory*** and named after it's *.vue* file. CSS files must be imported into the component's script area, so it can be read by Storybook.
